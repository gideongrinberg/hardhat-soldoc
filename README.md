# hardhat-soldoc

A documentation generator for Hardhat Solidity projects. This was very quickly hacked together based on code from [ItsNickBarry's documentation generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-docgen). I'd recommend using that unless you 100% need Markdown. I've not released it to npm, so just copy src/ into your scripts folder (it works fine with Typescript projects, as long as you `allowJs: true` in your tsconfig.json).
